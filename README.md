Multiple linear regression is an extension of simple linear regression that allows for the modeling of relationships between a dependent variable and multiple independent variables. It is used when you have more than one predictor variable that can potentially influence the dependent variable.

In multiple linear regression, the relationship between the dependent variable (y) and the independent variables (x1, x2, x3, ..., xn) is represented by the following equation:

y = b0 + b1x1 + b2x2 + b3x3 + ... + bnxn

where:

y is the dependent variable (response variable) that we want to predict.

x1, x2, x3, ..., xn are the independent variables (predictor variables).

b0 is the intercept or constant term, representing the value of y when all the independent variables are zero.

b1, b2, b3, ..., bn are the slope coefficients, indicating how the dependent variable changes with a one-unit change in each of the independent variables,
holding the other variables constant.

Similar to simple linear regression, the coefficients (b0, b1, b2, ..., bn) are estimated using the ordinary least squares (OLS) method, which minimizes the sum of 
the squared differences between the predicted values and the actual values of the dependent variable.

Multiple linear regression allows us to analyze the relationship between the dependent variable and multiple predictors simultaneously. 
It helps determine the relative importance and contribution of each independent variable to the dependent variable.

It is important to note that multiple linear regression assumes a linear relationship between the variables and certain assumptions about the error term.
Additionally, it is essential to consider factors like multicollinearity (high correlation between predictor variables),
homoscedasticity (constant variance of the errors), and normality of the error distribution when interpreting the results.
